**Day 1: 6th April 2021**
I started on the next FCC project, which is a calculator. I passed all the simple tests, which involved having the things exist. And then when it came to do the calculations that got more complicated. I thought I'd worked out how to do it, but it's not doing what I think it should. So I'm going to come back to that another day and hopefully it will be obvious.
