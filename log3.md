**Day 1: 6th April 2021**
I started on the next FCC project, which is a calculator. I passed all the simple tests, which involved having the things exist. And then when it came to do the calculations that got more complicated. I thought I'd worked out how to do it, but it's not doing what I think it should. So I'm going to come back to that another day and hopefully it will be obvious.

**Day 2: 7th April 2021**
Continued to work on the calculator. At one point I had nearly all the tests passing, updated it to pass another test, but then it passed fewer. It doesn't help that you can't see much code at a time in Codepen.

**Day 3: 8th April 2021**
Finally finished the calculator! After ages fixing things and breaking other things, I finally got it sorted out. It helped when I copied the code into VS Code so I could see more of it and Codepen didn't update every time I typed something. Streamlining it was the way to go in the end.

**Day 4: 9th April 2021**
I started the last project, the 25+5 timer. Which has 29 tests! I put the elements in and some state and functionality and formatting and it passes 18 of them. I still have the timer to go. But I went mad trying to get the time-left ID into the right format - I tried a couple of things then ended up converting everything to seconds and then having to deal with 1 hour needing to be changed to 60 minutes. I got there in the end.
