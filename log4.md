**Day 1: 23rd July 2021**
I started on the Jest testing. Which was fine until I came to mock the APIs. I thought I had it sorted in the previous project, but that used Axios, although I thought this should be broadly the same. At least I solved the problem with the App test not rendering App - it should be called .tsx, not .ts.
