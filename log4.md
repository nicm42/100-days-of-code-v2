**Day 1: 23rd July 2021**
I started on the Jest testing. Which was fine until I came to mock the APIs. I thought I had it sorted in the previous project, but that used Axios, although I thought this should be broadly the same. At least I solved the problem with the App test not rendering App - it should be called .tsx, not .ts.

**Day 2: 24th July 2021**
I spent some time today going through every possible way of mocking my APIs, without it working at any point. In the end I wrote a simplified version in CodeSandbox, which also didn't work. And I found that the tests don't run in Firefox, you have to open it in Chrome.
But I also got to spend some of my day having fun with PHP. I did a tutorial on creating what is effectively a blog using MySQL. As always Linux is a bit different, and although the instructor wrote to the database with the root user and no password, that apparently doesn't work on Linux unless you're logged in as root. Which I didn't know was possible - unless it means you have your browser open as root. But I created a new user and that solved it. But it was fun to see it all come together, even if I didn't 100% understand all of it. I did a quick tutorial on cookies too, which are very easy to set and use (in PHP).

**Day 3: 26th July 2021**
I finally got the API mocking sorted by using Axios. I then got most of the testing done in Jest, I just have a few errors I can't fix that will hopefully become obvious, and the Express bits to test.
