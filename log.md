# Done today
**25th May 2020**
Set up this file. Set up v2 of my portfolio in GitHub.

**26th May 2020**
Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.

**27th May 2020**
Did the skill section and set up the projects section on my portfolio. What took the most time was adding in screenshots and information, which is the boring part.

**28th May 2020**
Did the contacts section and some desktop layout bits. Got stuck on sizing something, so I am hoping it will become obvious tomorrow.

**29th May 2020**
Spent some time adding effects and changing my mind a lot. Looking at examples on codepen was really helpful for deciding what I wanted to do.

**30th May 2020**
Finished my portfolio! Spent ages wondering why transform-origin wasn't working when I added it in a mixin. I eventually established that it was happy if both it and the transform were outside of the mixin. So I left it like that. But otherwise it works well on everything I tested it on and looks so much better than the old version.

**1st June 2020**
Went through my GitHub repositories, updating the readmes where they needed updating, archiving old ones and deleting all my forked copies of the Hacktoberfest ones. Then Scrimba emailed about a 7 day JavaScript course with challenges a bit like codewars. So I did the first one - I find out tomorrow if I did it right. It included Jasmine tests in the JS file, so that was interesting to see. I should take note and use it to learn Jasmine and find uses of it to practise it.

**2nd June 2020**
I think the Scrimba JS course is too easy, but it's good to have something to keep me doing some JS every day. I started looking at testing with FreeCodeCamp. But after four challenges I gave up because I was just pasting things without understanding why - and there's no explanation. There are a few video tutorials I've found, so I will go through those and see if any are useful.

**3rd June 2020**
I found some video tutorials on testing and watched a couple on unit testing - one on Jasmine and one on Jest. They are pretty similar, just some different syntax, but it was the principle and general usage I really needed to understand.

**4th June 2020**
I continued with the Jest testing video, with the integration part. I just need to finish it with the user testing and then try some testing for myself. I realised I didn't get an email about yesterday's Scrimba JS challenge. So then I did yesterday's and it took me a while to get my head around how to do it, but I got there in the end. Today's I wasn't sure about until I remembered I'd done it in FreeCodeCamp.

**8th June 2020**
I've spent the past couple of days on JavaScript unit (and integeration and user testing). Starting with the easiest one, unit testing, I took some 8kyu (and a 7kyu) kata in codewars and put in a project to do the testing myself. I'm glad I choe easy katas because the testing took me a while. But I am getting the hang of it now. So next I need to find some harder katas where I can split things into multiple functions and do more testing.

**9th June 2020**
Did two 6kyu katas. The testing came in useful because I could test stages to check it was ok, whereas I'd usually just do a console log.

**10th June 2020**
Did a 5kyu kata. It took me longer than I thought it would, and didn't help that I did more than the kata was asking for, as I found when one of codewars tests found. But I can really see why you'd put small bits in functions so you can test those bits are working.

**11th June 2020**
I went through three videos of a series on testing, so now I understand it a bit better. I need to do the rest of the videos to see how better to apply it. I did the first day of Scrimba's email CSS challenges. It was really easy, but they did say it would get harder.

**15th June 2020**
Caught up on Scrimba's CSS email challenges. I definitely need to look into CSS animations (rather than just transitions) some more. But so far it's all been pretty easy. But the past few days have all been things I only learnt recently, so it's good that I spent a lot of time in 100 days round 2 on CSS.

**16th June 2020**
Did the second in the series of the 5kyu kata I did last week. It was hard, even though it built on the code I'd written for the first part. But I am starting to get more of an idea of what tests to write and what order to write them/the code.

**17th June 2020**
Finished off the Scrimba CSS series. Which never got hard, just had more animations in. I definitely need to play with animations a bit more. I watched another testing video. it was about mocking APIs and I really need to revise APIs and use them some more, but I remember enough to follow along, and it was very helpful in explaining unit testing generally.

**18th June 2020**
Watched some more unit testing videos. Then, because it was short and I didn't have much time, watched one on Parcel.
