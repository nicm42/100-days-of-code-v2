# Done today
**Day 1: 25th May 2020**
Set up this file. Set up v2 of my portfolio in GitHub.

**Day 2: 26th May 2020**
Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.

**Day 3: 27th May 2020**
Did the skill section and set up the projects section on my portfolio. What took the most time was adding in screenshots and information, which is the boring part.

**Day 4: 28th May 2020**
Did the contacts section and some desktop layout bits. Got stuck on sizing something, so I am hoping it will become obvious tomorrow.

**Day 5: 29th May 2020**
Spent some time adding effects and changing my mind a lot. Looking at examples on codepen was really helpful for deciding what I wanted to do.

**Day 6: 30th May 2020**
Finished my portfolio! Spent ages wondering why transform-origin wasn't working when I added it in a mixin. I eventually established that it was happy if both it and the transform were outside of the mixin. So I left it like that. But otherwise it works well on everything I tested it on and looks so much better than the old version.

**Day 7: 1st June 2020**
Went through my GitHub repositories, updating the readmes where they needed updating, archiving old ones and deleting all my forked copies of the Hacktoberfest ones. Then Scrimba emailed about a 7 day JavaScript course with challenges a bit like codewars. So I did the first one - I find out tomorrow if I did it right. It included Jasmine tests in the JS file, so that was interesting to see. I should take note and use it to learn Jasmine and find uses of it to practise it.

**Day 8: 2nd June 2020**
I think the Scrimba JS course is too easy, but it's good to have something to keep me doing some JS every day. I started looking at testing with FreeCodeCamp. But after four challenges I gave up because I was just pasting things without understanding why - and there's no explanation. There are a few video tutorials I've found, so I will go through those and see if any are useful.

**Day 9: 3rd June 2020**
I found some video tutorials on testing and watched a couple on unit testing - one on Jasmine and one on Jest. They are pretty similar, just some different syntax, but it was the principle and general usage I really needed to understand.

**Day 10: 4th June 2020**
I continued with the Jest testing video, with the integration part. I just need to finish it with the user testing and then try some testing for myself. I realised I didn't get an email about yesterday's Scrimba JS challenge. So then I did yesterday's and it took me a while to get my head around how to do it, but I got there in the end. Today's I wasn't sure about until I remembered I'd done it in FreeCodeCamp.

**Day 11: 8th June 2020**
I've spent the past couple of days on JavaScript unit (and integeration and user testing). Starting with the easiest one, unit testing, I took some 8kyu (and a 7kyu) kata in codewars and put in a project to do the testing myself. I'm glad I choe easy katas because the testing took me a while. But I am getting the hang of it now. So next I need to find some harder katas where I can split things into multiple functions and do more testing.

**Day 12: 9th June 2020**
Did two 6kyu katas. The testing came in useful because I could test stages to check it was ok, whereas I'd usually just do a console log.

**Day 13: 10th June 2020**
Did a 5kyu kata. It took me longer than I thought it would, and didn't help that I did more than the kata was asking for, as I found when one of codewars tests found. But I can really see why you'd put small bits in functions so you can test those bits are working.

**Day 14: 11th June 2020**
I went through three videos of a series on testing, so now I understand it a bit better. I need to do the rest of the videos to see how better to apply it. I did the first day of Scrimba's email CSS challenges. It was really easy, but they did say it would get harder.

**Day 15: 15th June 2020**
Caught up on Scrimba's CSS email challenges. I definitely need to look into CSS animations (rather than just transitions) some more. But so far it's all been pretty easy. But the past few days have all been things I only learnt recently, so it's good that I spent a lot of time in 100 days round 2 on CSS.

**Day 16: 16th June 2020**
Did the second in the series of the 5kyu kata I did last week. It was hard, even though it built on the code I'd written for the first part. But I am starting to get more of an idea of what tests to write and what order to write them/the code.

**Day 17: 17th June 2020**
Finished off the Scrimba CSS series. Which never got hard, just had more animations in. I definitely need to play with animations a bit more. I watched another testing video. it was about mocking APIs and I really need to revise APIs and use them some more, but I remember enough to follow along, and it was very helpful in explaining unit testing generally.

**Day 18: 18th June 2020**
Watched some more unit testing videos. Then, because it was short and I didn't have much time, watched one on Parcel.

**Day 19: 19th June 2020**
I did a couple of 7kyu katas for some light relief and then found a couple series that start at 7kyu and get harder. And then took ages on the 7kyus refactoring them to have fewer lines of code.

**Day 20: 20th June 2020**
I set up a project with Parcel, which took a while. It turns out it doesn't like it if there's nothing in the body apart from the js file. And then Jest complained about the js importing the scss, although it turns out you can just add the scss into the html's head. I think I set up ESLint, but I'm not sure if it's working yet. And then I set up ome tests. Next I need to work out properly what I'm doing in JS and design something in Figma.

**Day 21: 21st June 2020**
I did a couple of 6kyus that were in the series I did on the 19th. One wasn't too hard, but the other took a long time - the discussions did say people thought it was closer to a 5kyu than a 6kyu. I started my project layout in Figma, but I need to think about how to make it more interesting/have the relevant bits stand out.

**Day 22: 22nd June 2020**
Finished most of the testing challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Although they're a different language I understand now much better what they were trying to teach me. I then did a few katas on codewars - I found another couple of series that have n easy and a hard, which make the hard ones much easier to do.

**Day 23: 27th June 2020**
Took some time off to watch tennis and be too hot to turn on a computer. It meant I was looking forward to getting back into coding. I decided to ease myself in with some codewars katas. There was a 6kyu one in this week's email that looked interesting and was based on another kata. So I did that kata, and when I looked at the solutions I discovered I'd forgotten replace was a thing (again). I was close to 4kyu, so I did a 7kyu one. And then although I was then at 4kyu it was overall, I was still at 5kyu for JavaScript. So I have to do some more to achieve that goal.

**Day 24: 28th June 2020**
Goal achieved! I got 4kyu in JavaScript. I did the 6kyu kata that went with the one I did yesterday. Using the best practise solution made it much easier. But since I am 4kyu overall, that got me a lot less close to 4kyu in JavaScript than I thought it would. I found an interesting 5kyu kata that people said was much easier, so I did that and it didn't take long. So now I am 4kyu in JavaScript! Now I've achieved that, I need to get back to projects so I can tick off some more of my learning goals.

**Day 25: 29th June 2020**
I got an email from Kevin Powell (on his email list) that talked about how he learned and one of the things he mentioned was that once he understood something new he'd make a video on it. I've seen lots of things about explaining what you know to help you remember it. Having gone "Oh, yes, replace() is a thing, I must remember that" at the weekend, I thought I'd write a blog post about it. Which turned out to take a lot longer than I thought it would. Not to mention fiddling with the blog: I thought going with wordpress.com, where you can't change much, would mean I wouldn't spend ages fiddling with it. I was wrong. I am no linking to it yet because a blog with one post isn't much. Plus I still have the example stuff up and need to sort out the about and contact pages.

**Day 26: 30th June 2020**
Work wiped me out, so I watched some videos. One on focus styles was really interesting and I need to go back to my portfolio to add them in. Then one on parallax, which I need to try out. Then I watched one Coder Coder's series on making a Frontend Mentor layout. It's really useful to see how someone would approach it - it's helped me understand how to approach that sort of thing myself. Then I sorted out the About and Contact pages on my blog, which didn't take long, and signed up up Scrimba's 10 day JS challenge. And decided to number the days because although I'm not doing 100 days of code again, it's useful to see how much I've learnt in a certain number of days.

**Day 27: 3rd July 2020**
I caught up with Coder Coder's series on coding a Frontend Mentor layout. I think I want to try another, now that I've seen her way of doing it. I caught up with Scrimba's JS challenges, but they are still really easy. Then I watched Ania's video on making the Chrome dinosaur game. The code is surprisingly easy, it's knowing what sort of things to do to get it to do what you want that's hard, I think. I will try and work on adding to it. I thought I'd start creating infinite kittens, then discovered it uses IntersectionObserver, and although I've used MutationObserver I'm not sure about IntersectionObserver. Kevin has a YouTube series on it, so I will go through that at some point.

**Day 28: 4th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game, adding things to do it. And a long to do list! After playing it a lot I had to add an option to turn the background off because it was making me dizzy. But it's been fun and interesting and I've learnt more about how what we did in the tutorial works.

**Day 29: 5th July 2020**
I worked more on the dinosaur game. It took me ages to understand what was going on with the cacti when you click play after having died. Now I really understand what removeChild does. And then I spent ages trying to work out a formula to get the background and cacti to move at the same speed no matter what size your browser window is. And then I updated my blog talking about learning and realised the about page wasn't that useful.

**Day 30: 6th July 2020**
I worked more on the dinosaur game. Not as much time today, but I did get the background speed sorted and did a couple of small changes. I've almost done all the JS on the to do list!

**Day 31: 8th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game. Getting it work in lower gravity was not quite how I expected, but I worked it out in the end.

**Day 32: 10th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game. I sored out the high scores for Earth and the moon and made it work if you tap the screen. I also added some animation to the end to have the dinosaur fall over and the obstacles fade out.

**Day 33: 11th July 2020**
I did quite a bit of CSS on the dinosaur game. It doesn't look like much but the toggle took a while as it needed to be a checkbox rather than a button. Then when I first did it I discovered it wasn't accessible, so then I needed to re-do it and then re-work out how to add the on and off text.

**Day 34: 12th July 2020**
Did some work on the CSS on the dinosaur game, sorting out the layout. It looks so much better with a decent font and with everything laid out, rather than next to each other.

**Day 35: 13th July 2020**
Played about with some images, so the game now involves a dragon jumping over curling rocks. Since they could be said to have been thrown at him, it means we no longer need the background. So all that time I spent getting it moving at the same speed as the cacti was useless... But I can use the background toggle as a sound toggle, so all that work is not completely lost.

**Day 36: 13th July 2020**
Finished the dinosaur game - which is now the dragon jupming game. And then when I tried it on mobile I found some things to change, so I will do that tomorrow. The sounds turned out to be a pain because I did the game over one first. When I press Play Again the page then reloads and the browser doesn't think I've pressed anything, if I haven't jumped. That was fixed by jumping before dying. I could put a lot of work in to fix that, but it's not going to be the end of the world if there's no sound on game over. Plus I've spent a lot of time on this game and have other things I want to get to, so it's time to stop adding in features.
