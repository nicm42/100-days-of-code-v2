Set up this file. Set up v2 of my portfolio in GitHub.

**26th May 2020**
Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.

**27th May 2020**
Did the skill section and set up the projects section on my portfolio. What took the most time was adding in screenshots and information, which is the boring part.

**28th May 2020**
Did the contacts section and some desktop layout bits. Got stuck on sizing something, so I am hoping it will become obvious tomorrow.

**29th May 2020**
Spent some time adding effects and changing my mind a lot. Looking at examples on codepen was really helpful for deciding what I wanted to do.

**30th May 2020**
Finished my portfolio! Spent ages wondering why transform-origin wasn't working when I added it in a mixin. I eventually established that it was happy if both it and the transform were outside of the mixin. So I left it like that. But otherwise it works well on everything I tested it on and looks so much better than the old version.
