Set up this file. Set up v2 of my portfolio in GitHub.

**26th May 2020**
Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.
