Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.

Did the skill section and set up the projects section on my portfolio. What took the most time was adding in screenshots and information, which is the boring part.
