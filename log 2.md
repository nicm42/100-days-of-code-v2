**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.

**Day 3: 15th November 2020**
Spent some more time on the Frontend Mentor accordion. I'd forgotten how much time it takes to postion everything to match the design. But for now I've just gone for getting everything in because it'll only move once the accordion answers are visible. I looked up CSS only accordion and it uses a hidden input checkbox, which I've used before, so it should definitely be possible.

**Day 4: 17th November 2020**
I discovered there are HTML tags to make the accordion work. I've added that in and it all just works! Very useful. I then finessed bits of the design. I hate the part where you've trying to position everyting and get it all matching up. It's naerly there, just need to work out the sizing (which will affect some of the positioning).

**Day 5: 18th November 2020**
I did today's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev challenge. I'm really liking these for getting me practising some JS and CSS, however far I want to go with it. This one took me a little while to get my head round, but once I did it was fun.

**Day 6: 19th November 2020**
I cauvght up with a few of the videos on my watch list. I learnt about big O notation, which I've seen and vaguely read about but didn't get. I do now! And also watched one with a designer improving one section of a website. It's amazing how he makes it look so amazing. I'm hoping if I watch enough of those I'll remember some of the techniques and work out for myself how to make things go from looking good to looking amazing.

**Day 7: 20th November 2020**
I started working on getting the accordion positioning and sizing to match up with the design. Mobile didn't take very long, but desktop is more of a pain and I'm not sure why. So I'm leaving it to come back to and hopefully it'll be obvious.

**Day 8: 23rd November 2020**
It is slightly more obvious - slightly being the operative word. I have got all the wording part sorted out, for the size the desktop design is at. The images are more tricky and something to come back to another day. I had them sorted for that size, but the minute you change the size slightly it all goes awry.

**Day 9: 25th November 2020**
Finally finished the accordion and submitted it! It took forever for a newbie challenge. I can definitely see how the Figma files would be a help, but I'm not sure I can justify a subscription at the moment. Maybe if I did a bigger challenge that was all about the looks.

**Day 10: 27th November 2020**
I spent some time, after I committed this, playing about with my email address in GitKraken. It wasn't working and now it is and I'm not sure ahy but I'm not going to touch it.
I made a small change on the accordion, based on feedback, and then look at some others to see how other people did it. I found one person to give some feedback to, but it's hard because unless they ask specific questions, it's hard to tell what level people are at.
