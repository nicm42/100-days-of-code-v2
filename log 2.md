**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.
