**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.

**Day 3: 15th November 2020**
Spent some more time on the Frontend Mentor accordion. I'd forgotten how much time it takes to postion everything to match the design. But for now I've just gone for getting everything in because it'll only move once the accordion answers are visible. I looked up CSS only accordion and it uses a hidden input checkbox, which I've used before, so it should definitely be possible.

**Day 4: 17th November 2020**
I discovered there are HTML tags to make the accordion work. I've added that in and it all just works! Very useful. I then finessed bits of the design. I hate the part where you've trying to position everyting and get it all matching up. It's naerly there, just need to work out the sizing (which will affect some of the positioning).

**Day 5: 18th November 2020**
I did today's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev challenge. I'm really liking these for getting me practising some JS and CSS, however far I want to go with it. This one took me a little while to get my head round, but once I did it was fun.

**Day 6: 19th November 2020**
I caught up with a few of the videos on my watch list. I learnt about big O notation, which I've seen and vaguely read about but didn't get. I do now! And also watched one with a designer improving one section of a website. It's amazing how he makes it look so amazing. I'm hoping if I watch enough of those I'll remember some of the techniques and work out for myself how to make things go from looking good to looking amazing.

**Day 7: 20th November 2020**
I started working on getting the accordion positioning and sizing to match up with the design. Mobile didn't take very long, but desktop is more of a pain and I'm not sure why. So I'm leaving it to come back to and hopefully it'll be obvious.

**Day 8: 23rd November 2020**
It is slightly more obvious - slightly being the operative word. I have got all the wording part sorted out, for the size the desktop design is at. The images are more tricky and something to come back to another day. I had them sorted for that size, but the minute you change the size slightly it all goes awry.

**Day 9: 25th November 2020**
Finally finished the accordion and submitted it! It took forever for a newbie challenge. I can definitely see how the Figma files would be a help, but I'm not sure I can justify a subscription at the moment. Maybe if I did a bigger challenge that was all about the looks.

**Day 10: 27th November 2020**
I spent some time, after I committed this, playing about with my email address in GitKraken. It wasn't working and now it is and I'm not sure ahy but I'm not going to touch it.
I made a small change on the accordion, based on feedback, and then look at some others to see how other people did it. I found one person to give some feedback to, but it's hard because unless they ask specific questions, it's hard to tell what level people are at.

**Day 11: 28th November 2020**
I caught up on some of the (many) videos on my YouTube watch list. I have more ideas of some cool things to include on a website I will make at some point soon.

**Day 12: 29th November 2020**
I did this week's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge, which was to make a flex gallery where an image expands when you click it. Which is something I've been thinking of adding into a website, so it was useful to try out.

**Day 13: 30th November 2020**
I watched some more videos from my YouTube watch list. It's finally down to 30 videos! Some of them are just to skim through, some of them I'm saving for when I'm going to use the thing in it. But some of them I can definitely watch sooner and get that list more under control.

**Day 14: 1st December 2020**
I discovered Scrimba are doing a JavaScriptmas challenge, so I did that. It was very easy, but they say it gets harder. I also did day 1 of Advent of Code, which wasn't easy and says it'll get harder...

**Day 15: 2nd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 16: 3rd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 17: 4th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and part 1 of today's Advent of Code challenge. I tried part 2 but then realised I was spending a lot of time on it when there other things I want to do. So I gave up and set up a FrontEnd Mentor challenge that involves APIs, as that's definitely something I need to practise.

**Day 18: 5th December 2020**
Spent most of the day working through a video on Webpack by Colt Steel, via FreeCodeCamp. It was v4 rather than v5 so I had to make a few changes, based on comments. And then added Babel and autoprefixer, which took a little while for me to work out myself. But now I understand what's going on with it. The proof will be tomorrow when I try and apply it on the project I started yesterday.

**Day 19: 6th December 2020**
I installed webpack into the Frontend Mentor IP address challenge, then tested out the API. I then went installed Jest and learnt about mocking asynch code in Jest, but established there's nothing to test yet because all I'm doing is getting some data from the API. I then installed Leaflet JS, but tomorrow I need to sort out a map service for it to use.

**Day 20: 7th December 2020**
I forgot to log that I've been keeping on with Scrimba's JavaScriptmas every day.
I sorted out the map service for the map. And then sorted out the HTML and set up the CSS. I'm still not 100% sure how I'm going to do everything, but at least now I have an input and some outputs, so I can do the JS (and JS testing) for those.

**Day 21: 8th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScript challenge, which was a bit more involved, but it was fun. I didn't have time to get into the IP address project, so I watched a video on Scrimba with a mock React interview. I don't know React (yet) but it was interesting to see how to think through a problem.

**Day 22: 12th December 2020**
It feels like JavaScript suddenly got easier! I thought I had loads to do on the IP address project, but it didn't take long to get it looking roughly the same as the design and all the data appearing where it should. It still needs a lot of refinements, but it's feeling a lot closer to being finished now.

**Day 23: 13th December 2020**
Yesterday I couldn't get the API to pick up the correct IP address, but that turned out to be a quick fix this morning. I'm hoping that tomorrow it'll be a quick fix to get the map to change when you type in an IP address. I realised that you need to be able to searcg by domain, as well as IP address, so I will need to make some changes to handle that.

**Day 24: 14th December 2020**
Yesterday's problem was a quick fix - I was trying to get the map to use lat & long 0, 0, which it couldn't do. As soon as I gave it numbers that existed, it was fine. I then looked at error handling, which I thought was complicated and then turned out to be simple. I just need to work out where to put the errors on the page. Of course I've realised the map zoom doesn't work, for no reason I can find, so I am hoping that will be a quick fix tomorrow...

**Day 25: 15th December 2020**
And yesterday's problem was also a quick fix. I would say I wasn't surprised, but one of these days it'll be something complicated. The JavaScript is pretty much done, so I worked on getting the layout closer to the design images, at least at the sizes they provided. I am down to the small fixes now, but cumulatively that's still quite a bit of work.

**Day 26: 16th December 2020**
I was feeling like writing, so I created four blog posts - they just need some additions nearer the time, then posting at weekends. I worked on the IP address thing, sorting out the error messages and the CSS at other screen sizes.

**Day 27: 17th December 2020**
In a change to the usual, yeterday's problem took me a while to fix. Although it was still simple, once I figured it out. I fixed some SASS to make it better/more readable/easier to change. And tried it on my phone, then found a few things to fix. All I need to do now is Cypress testing, test on Edge and then re-test how everything looks on all the browsers at all the sizes.

**Day 28: 18th December 2020**
I spent today going mad. First I couldn't get Cypress to work with Webpack. It's a known thing that it doesn't pay well with Webpack 5, but the fix I found didn't help - it just gave me a different error. Then when I tried to deploy to Vercel it failed the npm rum build command for no reason I can find. I ended up including the dist folder on Github and then Vercel picked up index.js from the src folder to use as the html. I ended up deplying on Netlify, which seems happy. And then when I submited my solution it has an error in the HTML validation, except the HTML excerpt isn't in there - something has added it somewhere. I'm chalking today up to experience and maybe it'll all be something that makes sense later when I've learned more.

**Day 29: 19th December 2020**
I did of tidying on GitHub then decided to look into GitHub profile readme. It's pretty cool what you can do. I've bunged some things in there, but I need to think about what I actually want to do with it.

**Day 30: 20th December 2020**
After having watched a couple of videos of people doing CSS Battle, I decided to give it a go. It started easy, but then ramped up! But I have used clip-path, having watched a video on it this week, so I am excited about that. It's not the sort of code you'd write for something you were releasing and I'm not bothering too much about making it short (but I might come back and do that later), but I'm having fun with it. I also finished off my GitHub readme, with a bit of text and a few tweaks to the layout.

**Day 31: 21st December 2020**
I got distracted on CSS Battle and spent more time on it than intended. It's like playing a game, you just want to play the next level. I then watched Kevin Powell's video on Intersetion Observer intro. I've used the MutationObserver and mostly understood it, so I thought I'd understand Intersection Observer, since it's similar. And then I tried to use it and found I didn't. Now I get it. I am going to watch the rest of the videos in his series on the exciting things you can do with it, and then try it out for myself.

**Day 32: 22nd December 2020**
I finished off Kevin's series on te IntersectionObserver. I have another on my watch list about lazy loading, so I'm interested to see if it's any different to the last one of the IntersectionObserver series, which was lazy loading. And then I have no excuse not to go back to Infinite Kittens and try it all out for myself.

**Day 33: 23rd December 2020**
It was definitely worth watching Kevin's more recent video on lazy loading because you can do it without using IntersectionObserver. When he showed it I realised I had seen it before, but at the time I hadn't really realised what lazy loading was. I also spent a whole lot of time on today's JavaScriptmas because it involved some CSS and you can endlessly make changes if you're not careful.

**Day 34: 24th December 2020**
I started setting up Infinite Kittens. I thought I understand APIs now, I'll just set up the API quickly. And no, that keeps giving me CORS problems, even though they say in the forum that it shouldn't happen. And I set this up with Parcel, which gave me Regenerator Runtime problems and gitignore problems. All of which are something to fix tomorrow, when I have more time to find fixes to all of them.

**Day 35: 25th December 2020**
The CORS problems turned out to be a 404 error, which Parcel makes look like a CORS error. And the reason for the 404 error was that I was using the wrong API link. Once I put the right one in, it worked and I got cat data. After that the rest was easy and I've added some images to the page. I just need to think about whether I'm going to do any formatting on them, and also add the Intersection Observer for infinite scroll. It's just annoying that the API doesn't have many images classified as kittens - Infinite Cats just doesn't sound as good as Infinite Kittens.

**Day 36: 28th December 2020**
Spent a couple of days playing with new Linux distros. Came back to this and discovered I don't even had node installed, neer mind npm or parcel. So I had to install all that. Added the Intersection Observer, realised I couldn't do it the way I had been, since I'd need to pass the data to the Intersection Observer (or save it globally). And then discovered that infinite scroll is a bit more complicated because you need to work out what is interacting and whether they're going up or down, so I will need to look into that some more.

**Day 37: 30th December 2020**
I spent today getting ESLint and Prettier set up an working. It took two videos to get it all set up, then I still couldn't get it to work in CSS and found that uninstalling, then reinstalling, with a VSCode restart sorted it out... I then looked at Kevin's list of extensions he use from a recent video, and some of the comments, and installed some of those.

**Day 38: 31st December 2020**
I looked up how to do infinite scroll and realised it's simple. So in Infinite Kittens I temporarily changed the API for some random cat images. Which turned out to be a bit complicated with Parcel, so I had to put them in the HTML so it converted them and put them in the dist folder, then used their names. Then added in the IntersectionObserver and it just worked! The Cat API doesn't have a limit for calls, so I added it back in and it's all working. I just need to do more testing and make it look a bit more interesting.

**Day 39: 2nd January 2021**
I did some Cypress testing, which involved a lot of googling to check how the IntersectionObserver works with it. Then added some CSS. I think it's basically done, it just needs testing on other browsers. But it doesn't look like I can open them using Parcel without uploading everything - I need to do more googling on this (Parcel is not easy to google).

**Day 40: 4th January 2021**
I found that it is possible to open the Parcel dev server on my mobile - it was just that my Firewall was blocking it. But then I  discovered that the IntersectionObserver isn't working on Chrome. But is in Vivaldi, which is also Chrome (it's not working on iOS either, but that could be a separate problem). I then got distracted by axe and fixing the accessibility errors it found. And Git thinking I'd updated a lot of files I haven't. the only reason I can think of is that I bookmarked my Projects folder in Nemo. We'll see if it happens again.

**Day 41: 25th January 2021**
Returned to this after a short break and found that i had the rootMargin the wrong way round - it worked much better on Chrome and iOS after I fixed it. But what I spent most of my evening on was getting it open on my mobile using Parcel's dev server. I eventually discovered it was because my computer's IP address had changed. But then I worked out how to set the Firewall up to let them in, so it'll all be much easier next time.

**Day 42: 26th January 2021**
Managed to get Infinite Kittens on Netlify using build. I don't think I'd quite realised before that you can build on there the same as you can on your computer. I'd previously found something on StackOverflow with some advice on the topic and it worked. It just managed to look like it didn't... I just need to test it on Windows and then it'll be done!

**Day 43: 27th January 2021**
I tested Infinite Cats in Edge and it works, so I declared it done. I went to update my GitHub Profile, discovered it was more up-to-date in GitHub than on my computer because I have a thing in it that's fetching my Hashnode posts. So I discovered how to use Git stash and resolve merge conflicts.
I then started Wes Bos's React course. The npm installation I had to do twice because so much of it failed the first time - but worked the secod even though I hadn't changed anything. I am glad I already understand what's going on with all of that, as when I tried learning React before I was fine in FreeCodeCamp but as soon as I got outside of it all of the Create React App stuff completely confused me.

**Day 44: 28th January 2021**
I did three videos of Wes Bos's course. It all looks familiar and makes sense so far. I am going slowly on it in the hopes that doing a bit each day will help me remember it, as I'll be doing some React every day for a while.

**Day 45: 29th January 2021**
Another React video today. I might have got two in, but I realised the reason Prettier wasn't working was because I needed to install it for the project. So I did, but then it installed a more recent version of ESLint than it wanted in the package.json and threw a wobbler. I ended up having to install all the packages again. It's possible I could get Prettier working in this project, but I don't want to break anything again - I feel like I'm spending more time breaking things and installing things than I am learning React. I will sort it out when I come to do a React project that I start from scratch.

**Day 46: 30th January 2021**
Another two React videos today. And (almost) accidentally managed to fix Prettier to get it working in my React project. Although then I started on my Portfolio and found it was working in there. So I'm not sure how it's going to cope with a project with JS where I want to use ESLint.
I did quite a bit on my Portfolio, tidying it up a bit and making it look a little better. I did write some of it in the most insane way and although it all makes sense, it's a bit OTT with the mixins, I think. It's not broke, so I'll leave it as it is.

**Day 47: 31st January 2021**
Made a couple of updates to my portfolio, moving the blog link and adding an avatar image so the about section isn't so small on large screens. I think the layout changes are all done, I just need to update the projects now.
I did one React video on React Router, which I had heard of, but knew nothing about. It's quite cool, but hard to get your head around. I wonder if this is something that Redux does - I will find out when it comes to learning it to get the relevant freeCodeCamp certification.

**Day 48: 1st February 2021**
Did a couple of React videos. Talking about this and using constructors was familiar - I'm not sure I quite understood why to use them. But then it turns out there's a better way anyway. It's familiar (from JS and what I learnt before) but all done in a different way, which then makes it complicated.

**Day 49: 2nd February 2021**
Learnt about State in today's video. Which I think was simpler than when I learnt it before. I think I understand it and I can see why it's important/useful. I don't feel like I could write my own React thing, but then I am less than halfway through the course, so that's not unreasonable.

**Day 50: 3rd February 2021**
A couple more videos today, using state. And props. Which are definitely things I'm going to need to practise some more before I get them, I think.

**Day 51: 4th February 2021**
Two more videos with some more state. I think I'm starting to get it.

**Day 52: 6th February 2021**
Worked on my portfolio today, which mostly meant updating the list of projects to match the pinned ones I have in GitHub. And a few other minor changes. And some looking at accessibility which took a while until I established that actually what I have is fine, the tool is just unhappy about background images and gradients. It's now done! Until the next time I need to update it, but then it is the sort of thing that will need updating as I create new projects that are worth adding, and no doubt add some tweaks.

**Day 53: 7th February 2021**
Two more React videos, one with Firebase which was interesting because I'd heard of it, established it's not something I need yet, but now I see a bit of what it does. And another on local storage, which I knew about, but not used with React state before.
