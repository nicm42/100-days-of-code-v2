**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.

**Day 3: 15th November 2020**
Spent some more time on the Frontend Mentor accordion. I'd forgotten how much time it takes to postion everything to match the design. But for now I've just gone for getting everything in because it'll only move once the accordion answers are visible. I looked up CSS only accordion and it uses a hidden input checkbox, which I've used before, so it should definitely be possible.

**Day 4: 17th November 2020**
I discovered there are HTML tags to make the accordion work. I've added that in and it all just works! Very useful. I then finessed bits of the design. I hate the part where you've trying to position everyting and get it all matching up. It's naerly there, just need to work out the sizing (which will affect some of the positioning).

**Day 5: 18th November 2020**
I did today's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev challenge. I'm really liking these for getting me practising some JS and CSS, however far I want to go with it. This one took me a little while to get my head round, but once I did it was fun.

**Day 6: 19th November 2020**
I cauvght up with a few of the videos on my watch list. I learnt about big O notation, which I've seen and vaguely read about but didn't get. I do now! And also watched one with a designer improving one section of a website. It's amazing how he makes it look so amazing. I'm hoping if I watch enough of those I'll remember some of the techniques and work out for myself how to make things go from looking good to looking amazing.

**Day 7: 20th November 2020**
I started working on getting the accordion positioning and sizing to match up with the design. Mobile didn't take very long, but desktop is more of a pain and I'm not sure why. So I'm leaving it to come back to and hopefully it'll be obvious.

**Day 8: 23rd November 2020**
It is slightly more obvious - slightly being the operative word. I have got all the wording part sorted out, for the size the desktop design is at. The images are more tricky and something to come back to another day. I had them sorted for that size, but the minute you change the size slightly it all goes awry.

**Day 9: 25th November 2020**
Finally finished the accordion and submitted it! It took forever for a newbie challenge. I can definitely see how the Figma files would be a help, but I'm not sure I can justify a subscription at the moment. Maybe if I did a bigger challenge that was all about the looks.

**Day 10: 27th November 2020**
I spent some time, after I committed this, playing about with my email address in GitKraken. It wasn't working and now it is and I'm not sure ahy but I'm not going to touch it.
I made a small change on the accordion, based on feedback, and then look at some others to see how other people did it. I found one person to give some feedback to, but it's hard because unless they ask specific questions, it's hard to tell what level people are at.

**Day 11: 28th November 2020**
I caught up on some of the (many) videos on my YouTube watch list. I have more ideas of some cool things to include on a website I will make at some point soon.

**Day 12: 29th November 2020**
I did this week's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge, which was to make a flex gallery where an image expands when you click it. Which is something I've been thinking of adding into a website, so it was useful to try out.

**Day 13: 30th November 2020**
I watched some more videos from my YouTube watch list. It's finally down to 30 videos! Some of them are just to skim through, some of them I'm saving for when I'm going to use the thing in it. But some of them I can definitely watch sooner and get that list more under control.

**Day 14: 1st December 2020**
I discovered Scrimba are doing a JavaScriptmas challenge, so I did that. It was very easy, but they say it gets harder. I also did day 1 of Advent of Code, which wasn't easy and says it'll get harder...

**Day 15: 2nd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 16: 3rd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 17: 4th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and part 1 of today's Advent of Code challenge. I tried part 2 but then realised I was spending a lot of time on it when there other things I want to do. So I gave up and set up a FrontEnd Mentor challenge that involves APIs, as that's definitely something I need to practise.

**Day 18: 5th December 2020**
Spent most of the day working through a video on Webpack by Colt Steel, via FreeCodeCamp. It was v4 rather than v5 so I had to make a few changes, based on comments. And then added Babel and autoprefixer, which took a little while for me to work out myself. But now I understand what's going on with it. The proof will be tomorrow when I try and apply it on the project I started yesterday.

**Day 19: 6th December 2020**
I installed webpack into the Frontend Mentor IP address challenge, then tested out the API. I then went installed Jest and learnt about mocking asynch code in Jest, but established there's nothing to test yet because all I'm doing is getting some data from the API. I then installed Leaflet JS, but tomorrow I need to sort out a map service for it to use.

**Day 20: 7th December 2020**
I forgot to log that I've been keeping on with Scrimba's JavaScriptmas every day.
I sorted out the map service for the map. And then sorted out the HTML and set up the CSS. I'm still not 100% sure how I'm going to do everything, but at least now I have an input and some outputs, so I can do the JS (and JS testing) for those.

**Day 21: 8th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScript challenge, which was a bit more involved, but it was fun. I didn't have time to get into the IP address project, so I watched a video on Scrimba with a mock React interview. I don't know React (yet) but it was interesting to see how to think through a problem.

**Day 22: 12th December 2020**
It feels like JavaScript suddenly got easier! I thought I had loads to do on the IP address project, but it didn't take long to get it looking roughly the same as the design and all the data appearing where it should. It still needs a lot of refinements, but it's feeling a lot closer to being finished now.

**Day 23: 13th December 2020**
Yesterday I couldn't get the API to pick up the correct IP address, but that turned out to be a quick fix this morning. I'm hoping that tomorrow it'll be a quick fix to get the map to change when you type in an IP address. I realised that you need to be able to searcg by domain, as well as IP address, so I will need to make some changes to handle that.

**Day 24: 14th December 2020**
Yesterday's problem was a quick fix - I was trying to get the map to use lat & long 0, 0, which it couldn't do. As soon as I gave it numbers that existed, it was fine. I then looked at error handling, which I thought was complicated and then turned out to be simple. I just need to work out where to put the errors on the page. Of course I've realised the map zoom doesn't work, for no reason I can find, so I am hoping that will be a quick fix tomorrow...

**Day 25: 15th December 2020**
And yesterday's problem was also a quick fix. I would say I wasn't surprised, but one of these days it'll be something complicated. The JavaScript is pretty much done, so I worked on getting the layout closer to the design images, at least at the sizes they provided. I am down to the small fixes now, but cumulatively that's still quite a bit of work.

**Day 26: 16th December 2020**
I was feeling like writing, so I created four blog posts - they just need some additions nearer the time, then posting at weekends. I worked on the IP address thing, sorting out the error messages and the CSS at other screen sizes.

**Day 27: 17th December 2020**
In a change to the usual, yeterday's problem took me a while to fix. Although it was still simple, once I figured it out. I fixed some SASS to make it better/more readable/easier to change. And tried it on my phone, then found a few things to fix. All I need to do now is Cypress testing, test on Edge and then re-test how everything looks on all the browsers at all the sizes.

**Day 28: 18th December 2020**
I spent today going mad. First I couldn't get Cypress to work with Webpack. It's a known thing that it doesn't pay well with Webpack 5, but the fix I found didn't help - it just gave me a different error. Then when I tried to deploy to Vercel it failed the npm rum build command for no reason I can find. I ended up including the dist folder on Github and then Vercel picked up index.js from the src folder to use as the html. I ended up deplying on Netlify, which seems happy. And then when I submited my solution it has an error in the HTML validation, except the HTML excerpt isn't in there - something has added it somewhere. I'm chalking today up to experience and maybe it'll all be something that makes sense later when I've learned more.
