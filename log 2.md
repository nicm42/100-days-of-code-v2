**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.

**Day 3: 15th November 2020**
Spent some more time on the Frontend Mentor accordion. I'd forgotten how much time it takes to postion everything to match the design. But for now I've just gone for getting everything in because it'll only move once the accordion answers are visible. I looked up CSS only accordion and it uses a hidden input checkbox, which I've used before, so it should definitely be possible.

**Day 4: 17th November 2020**
I discovered there are HTML tags to make the accordion work. I've added that in and it all just works! Very useful. I then finessed bits of the design. I hate the part where you've trying to position everyting and get it all matching up. It's naerly there, just need to work out the sizing (which will affect some of the positioning).
