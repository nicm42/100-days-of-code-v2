**Day 1: 8th November 2020**
Did the CSS illustration parasol tutorial. It made it seem really simple, but I think I need to play with it some more to really understand everything that's going on with it.

**Day 2: 14th November 2020**
I went back to the cake illustration. I realised I need to put the elements on top of each other, rather than next to each other, so it'll still work when you change the window size. I did that, but it still looks so flat. I've tried skewing and rotating it and it never seems to look right.
I have up on that, at least for now, and did the Scrimba weekly dev challenge. Which reminded me how long it's been since I did anything apart from bits. So I went to Frontend Mentor and found a newbie accordion challenge, which should be good because I don't really know how to do an accordion. Especially not using JavaScript! Of course, it took me ages to work out how to set it up in GitKraken and then the project/Gulp set up took a while. I forgot how long all the adminy bits take.

**Day 3: 15th November 2020**
Spent some more time on the Frontend Mentor accordion. I'd forgotten how much time it takes to postion everything to match the design. But for now I've just gone for getting everything in because it'll only move once the accordion answers are visible. I looked up CSS only accordion and it uses a hidden input checkbox, which I've used before, so it should definitely be possible.

**Day 4: 17th November 2020**
I discovered there are HTML tags to make the accordion work. I've added that in and it all just works! Very useful. I then finessed bits of the design. I hate the part where you've trying to position everyting and get it all matching up. It's naerly there, just need to work out the sizing (which will affect some of the positioning).

**Day 5: 18th November 2020**
I did today's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev challenge. I'm really liking these for getting me practising some JS and CSS, however far I want to go with it. This one took me a little while to get my head round, but once I did it was fun.

**Day 6: 19th November 2020**
I caught up with a few of the videos on my watch list. I learnt about big O notation, which I've seen and vaguely read about but didn't get. I do now! And also watched one with a designer improving one section of a website. It's amazing how he makes it look so amazing. I'm hoping if I watch enough of those I'll remember some of the techniques and work out for myself how to make things go from looking good to looking amazing.

**Day 7: 20th November 2020**
I started working on getting the accordion positioning and sizing to match up with the design. Mobile didn't take very long, but desktop is more of a pain and I'm not sure why. So I'm leaving it to come back to and hopefully it'll be obvious.

**Day 8: 23rd November 2020**
It is slightly more obvious - slightly being the operative word. I have got all the wording part sorted out, for the size the desktop design is at. The images are more tricky and something to come back to another day. I had them sorted for that size, but the minute you change the size slightly it all goes awry.

**Day 9: 25th November 2020**
Finally finished the accordion and submitted it! It took forever for a newbie challenge. I can definitely see how the Figma files would be a help, but I'm not sure I can justify a subscription at the moment. Maybe if I did a bigger challenge that was all about the looks.

**Day 10: 27th November 2020**
I spent some time, after I committed this, playing about with my email address in GitKraken. It wasn't working and now it is and I'm not sure ahy but I'm not going to touch it.
I made a small change on the accordion, based on feedback, and then look at some others to see how other people did it. I found one person to give some feedback to, but it's hard because unless they ask specific questions, it's hard to tell what level people are at.

**Day 11: 28th November 2020**
I caught up on some of the (many) videos on my YouTube watch list. I have more ideas of some cool things to include on a website I will make at some point soon.

**Day 12: 29th November 2020**
I did this week's Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge, which was to make a flex gallery where an image expands when you click it. Which is something I've been thinking of adding into a website, so it was useful to try out.

**Day 13: 30th November 2020**
I watched some more videos from my YouTube watch list. It's finally down to 30 videos! Some of them are just to skim through, some of them I'm saving for when I'm going to use the thing in it. But some of them I can definitely watch sooner and get that list more under control.

**Day 14: 1st December 2020**
I discovered Scrimba are doing a JavaScriptmas challenge, so I did that. It was very easy, but they say it gets harder. I also did day 1 of Advent of Code, which wasn't easy and says it'll get harder...

**Day 15: 2nd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 16: 3rd December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and Advent of Code challenge.

**Day 17: 4th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScriptmas challenge and part 1 of today's Advent of Code challenge. I tried part 2 but then realised I was spending a lot of time on it when there other things I want to do. So I gave up and set up a FrontEnd Mentor challenge that involves APIs, as that's definitely something I need to practise.

**Day 18: 5th December 2020**
Spent most of the day working through a video on Webpack by Colt Steel, via FreeCodeCamp. It was v4 rather than v5 so I had to make a few changes, based on comments. And then added Babel and autoprefixer, which took a little while for me to work out myself. But now I understand what's going on with it. The proof will be tomorrow when I try and apply it on the project I started yesterday.

**Day 19: 6th December 2020**
I installed webpack into the Frontend Mentor IP address challenge, then tested out the API. I then went installed Jest and learnt about mocking asynch code in Jest, but established there's nothing to test yet because all I'm doing is getting some data from the API. I then installed Leaflet JS, but tomorrow I need to sort out a map service for it to use.

**Day 20: 7th December 2020**
I forgot to log that I've been keeping on with Scrimba's JavaScriptmas every day.
I sorted out the map service for the map. And then sorted out the HTML and set up the CSS. I'm still not 100% sure how I'm going to do everything, but at least now I have an input and some outputs, so I can do the JS (and JS testing) for those.

**Day 21: 8th December 2020**
I did today's JavaScript challenge, which was a bit more involved, but it was fun. I didn't have time to get into the IP address project, so I watched a video on Scrimba with a mock React interview. I don't know React (yet) but it was interesting to see how to think through a problem.

**Day 22: 12th December 2020**
It feels like JavaScript suddenly got easier! I thought I had loads to do on the IP address project, but it didn't take long to get it looking roughly the same as the design and all the data appearing where it should. It still needs a lot of refinements, but it's feeling a lot closer to being finished now.

**Day 23: 13th December 2020**
Yesterday I couldn't get the API to pick up the correct IP address, but that turned out to be a quick fix this morning. I'm hoping that tomorrow it'll be a quick fix to get the map to change when you type in an IP address. I realised that you need to be able to searcg by domain, as well as IP address, so I will need to make some changes to handle that.

**Day 24: 14th December 2020**
Yesterday's problem was a quick fix - I was trying to get the map to use lat & long 0, 0, which it couldn't do. As soon as I gave it numbers that existed, it was fine. I then looked at error handling, which I thought was complicated and then turned out to be simple. I just need to work out where to put the errors on the page. Of course I've realised the map zoom doesn't work, for no reason I can find, so I am hoping that will be a quick fix tomorrow...

**Day 25: 15th December 2020**
And yesterday's problem was also a quick fix. I would say I wasn't surprised, but one of these days it'll be something complicated. The JavaScript is pretty much done, so I worked on getting the layout closer to the design images, at least at the sizes they provided. I am down to the small fixes now, but cumulatively that's still quite a bit of work.

**Day 26: 16th December 2020**
I was feeling like writing, so I created four blog posts - they just need some additions nearer the time, then posting at weekends. I worked on the IP address thing, sorting out the error messages and the CSS at other screen sizes.

**Day 27: 17th December 2020**
In a change to the usual, yeterday's problem took me a while to fix. Although it was still simple, once I figured it out. I fixed some SASS to make it better/more readable/easier to change. And tried it on my phone, then found a few things to fix. All I need to do now is Cypress testing, test on Edge and then re-test how everything looks on all the browsers at all the sizes.

**Day 28: 18th December 2020**
I spent today going mad. First I couldn't get Cypress to work with Webpack. It's a known thing that it doesn't pay well with Webpack 5, but the fix I found didn't help - it just gave me a different error. Then when I tried to deploy to Vercel it failed the npm rum build command for no reason I can find. I ended up including the dist folder on Github and then Vercel picked up index.js from the src folder to use as the html. I ended up deplying on Netlify, which seems happy. And then when I submited my solution it has an error in the HTML validation, except the HTML excerpt isn't in there - something has added it somewhere. I'm chalking today up to experience and maybe it'll all be something that makes sense later when I've learned more.

**Day 29: 19th December 2020**
I did of tidying on GitHub then decided to look into GitHub profile readme. It's pretty cool what you can do. I've bunged some things in there, but I need to think about what I actually want to do with it.

**Day 30: 20th December 2020**
After having watched a couple of videos of people doing CSS Battle, I decided to give it a go. It started easy, but then ramped up! But I have used clip-path, having watched a video on it this week, so I am excited about that. It's not the sort of code you'd write for something you were releasing and I'm not bothering too much about making it short (but I might come back and do that later), but I'm having fun with it. I also finished off my GitHub readme, with a bit of text and a few tweaks to the layout.

**Day 31: 21st December 2020**
I got distracted on CSS Battle and spent more time on it than intended. It's like playing a game, you just want to play the next level. I then watched Kevin Powell's video on Intersetion Observer intro. I've used the MutationObserver and mostly understood it, so I thought I'd understand Intersection Observer, since it's similar. And then I tried to use it and found I didn't. Now I get it. I am going to watch the rest of the videos in his series on the exciting things you can do with it, and then try it out for myself.

**Day 32: 22nd December 2020**
I finished off Kevin's series on te IntersectionObserver. I have another on my watch list about lazy loading, so I'm interested to see if it's any different to the last one of the IntersectionObserver series, which was lazy loading. And then I have no excuse not to go back to Infinite Kittens and try it all out for myself.

**Day 33: 23rd December 2020**
It was definitely worth watching Kevin's more recent video on lazy loading because you can do it without using IntersectionObserver. When he showed it I realised I had seen it before, but at the time I hadn't really realised what lazy loading was. I also spent a whole lot of time on today's JavaScriptmas because it involved some CSS and you can endlessly make changes if you're not careful.

**Day 34: 24th December 2020**
I started setting up Infinite Kittens. I thought I understand APIs now, I'll just set up the API quickly. And no, that keeps giving me CORS problems, even though they say in the forum that it shouldn't happen. And I set this up with Parcel, which gave me Regenerator Runtime problems and gitignore problems. All of which are something to fix tomorrow, when I have more time to find fixes to all of them.

**Day 35: 25th December 2020**
The CORS problems turned out to be a 404 error, which Parcel makes look like a CORS error. And the reason for the 404 error was that I was using the wrong API link. Once I put the right one in, it worked and I got cat data. After that the rest was easy and I've added some images to the page. I just need to think about whether I'm going to do any formatting on them, and also add the Intersection Observer for infinite scroll. It's just annoying that the API doesn't have many images classified as kittens - Infinite Cats just doesn't sound as good as Infinite Kittens.

**Day 36: 28th December 2020**
Spent a couple of days playing with new Linux distros. Came back to this and discovered I don't even had node installed, neer mind npm or parcel. So I had to install all that. Added the Intersection Observer, realised I couldn't do it the way I had been, since I'd need to pass the data to the Intersection Observer (or save it globally). And then discovered that infinite scroll is a bit more complicated because you need to work out what is interacting and whether they're going up or down, so I will need to look into that some more.

**Day 37: 30th December 2020**
I spent today getting ESLint and Prettier set up an working. It took two videos to get it all set up, then I still couldn't get it to work in CSS and found that uninstalling, then reinstalling, with a VSCode restart sorted it out... I then looked at Kevin's list of extensions he use from a recent video, and some of the comments, and installed some of those.

**Day 38: 31st December 2020**
I looked up how to do infinite scroll and realised it's simple. So in Infinite Kittens I temporarily changed the API for some random cat images. Which turned out to be a bit complicated with Parcel, so I had to put them in the HTML so it converted them and put them in the dist folder, then used their names. Then added in the IntersectionObserver and it just worked! The Cat API doesn't have a limit for calls, so I added it back in and it's all working. I just need to do more testing and make it look a bit more interesting.

**Day 39: 2nd January 2021**
I did some Cypress testing, which involved a lot of googling to check how the IntersectionObserver works with it. Then added some CSS. I think it's basically done, it just needs testing on other browsers. But it doesn't look like I can open them using Parcel without uploading everything - I need to do more googling on this (Parcel is not easy to google).

**Day 40: 4th January 2021**
I found that it is possible to open the Parcel dev server on my mobile - it was just that my Firewall was blocking it. But then I  discovered that the IntersectionObserver isn't working on Chrome. But is in Vivaldi, which is also Chrome (it's not working on iOS either, but that could be a separate problem). I then got distracted by axe and fixing the accessibility errors it found. And Git thinking I'd updated a lot of files I haven't. the only reason I can think of is that I bookmarked my Projects folder in Nemo. We'll see if it happens again.

**Day 41: 25th January 2021**
Returned to this after a short break and found that i had the rootMargin the wrong way round - it worked much better on Chrome and iOS after I fixed it. But what I spent most of my evening on was getting it open on my mobile using Parcel's dev server. I eventually discovered it was because my computer's IP address had changed. But then I worked out how to set the Firewall up to let them in, so it'll all be much easier next time.

**Day 42: 26th January 2021**
Managed to get Infinite Kittens on Netlify using build. I don't think I'd quite realised before that you can build on there the same as you can on your computer. I'd previously found something on StackOverflow with some advice on the topic and it worked. It just managed to look like it didn't... I just need to test it on Windows and then it'll be done!

**Day 43: 27th January 2021**
I tested Infinite Cats in Edge and it works, so I declared it done. I went to update my GitHub Profile, discovered it was more up-to-date in GitHub than on my computer because I have a thing in it that's fetching my Hashnode posts. So I discovered how to use Git stash and resolve merge conflicts.
I then started Wes Bos's React course. The npm installation I had to do twice because so much of it failed the first time - but worked the secod even though I hadn't changed anything. I am glad I already understand what's going on with all of that, as when I tried learning React before I was fine in FreeCodeCamp but as soon as I got outside of it all of the Create React App stuff completely confused me.

**Day 44: 28th January 2021**
I did three videos of Wes Bos's course. It all looks familiar and makes sense so far. I am going slowly on it in the hopes that doing a bit each day will help me remember it, as I'll be doing some React every day for a while.

**Day 45: 29th January 2021**
Another React video today. I might have got two in, but I realised the reason Prettier wasn't working was because I needed to install it for the project. So I did, but then it installed a more recent version of ESLint than it wanted in the package.json and threw a wobbler. I ended up having to install all the packages again. It's possible I could get Prettier working in this project, but I don't want to break anything again - I feel like I'm spending more time breaking things and installing things than I am learning React. I will sort it out when I come to do a React project that I start from scratch.

**Day 46: 30th January 2021**
Another two React videos today. And (almost) accidentally managed to fix Prettier to get it working in my React project. Although then I started on my Portfolio and found it was working in there. So I'm not sure how it's going to cope with a project with JS where I want to use ESLint.
I did quite a bit on my Portfolio, tidying it up a bit and making it look a little better. I did write some of it in the most insane way and although it all makes sense, it's a bit OTT with the mixins, I think. It's not broke, so I'll leave it as it is.

**Day 47: 31st January 2021**
Made a couple of updates to my portfolio, moving the blog link and adding an avatar image so the about section isn't so small on large screens. I think the layout changes are all done, I just need to update the projects now.
I did one React video on React Router, which I had heard of, but knew nothing about. It's quite cool, but hard to get your head around. I wonder if this is something that Redux does - I will find out when it comes to learning it to get the relevant freeCodeCamp certification.

**Day 48: 1st February 2021**
Did a couple of React videos. Talking about this and using constructors was familiar - I'm not sure I quite understood why to use them. But then it turns out there's a better way anyway. It's familiar (from JS and what I learnt before) but all done in a different way, which then makes it complicated.

**Day 49: 2nd February 2021**
Learnt about State in today's video. Which I think was simpler than when I learnt it before. I think I understand it and I can see why it's important/useful. I don't feel like I could write my own React thing, but then I am less than halfway through the course, so that's not unreasonable.

**Day 50: 3rd February 2021**
A couple more videos today, using state. And props. Which are definitely things I'm going to need to practise some more before I get them, I think.

**Day 51: 4th February 2021**
Two more videos with some more state. I think I'm starting to get it.

**Day 52: 6th February 2021**
Worked on my portfolio today, which mostly meant updating the list of projects to match the pinned ones I have in GitHub. And a few other minor changes. And some looking at accessibility which took a while until I established that actually what I have is fine, the tool is just unhappy about background images and gradients. It's now done! Until the next time I need to update it, but then it is the sort of thing that will need updating as I create new projects that are worth adding, and no doubt add some tweaks.

**Day 53: 7th February 2021**
Two more React videos, one with Firebase which was interesting because I'd heard of it, established it's not something I need yet, but now I see a bit of what it does. And another on local storage, which I knew about, but not used with React state before.

**Day 54: 8th February 2021**
Two more React videos - some more state and props. I was thinking that it was all seeming familiar but I didn't know if I could do it myself. Then Wes challenged to make a remove order option, so I did. It took me a little while to work out where everything was and it was more complicated than he made it sound, but it did the job. And then I discovered what I'd done was to make a button to take one of that particular fish from your order, whereas he meant to make a button that removed all of that particular fish from your order. Which was a lot simpler. I kept my option though (with some renaming) because I was impressed that I'd managed to do it.

**Day 55: 11th February 2021**
Today's React video was about animation, which wasn't too hard. He used Stylus for his CSS, which I've heard of, but never looked into. Now I know what it is: basically the way you write SASS, but without the colons, semi-colons, and curly brackets. Which is very strange to read when you're used to CSS with all of those things.

**Day 56: 12th February 2021**
Today's React video was about prop types. He showed a couple and then I tried doing the rest on my own and got it mostly right, I just got a bit lost. It was hard to remember what was going on when I wrote it, it feels like a long time ago. But the React dev tools is so useful - I can just look at App and it tells me all the props. It's just remembering it's there.

**Day 57: 13th February 2021**
Today's React video was a long one about authentication. And I discovered the coding part is done, there's just some other bits to go. But It's definitely got to the point where it's more complicated than I need to do for my initial projects to practise React. So I may be coming back to bits later.
I also updated the Readmes on a couple of projects to add more detail. I will get through them all eventually.

**Day 58: 14th February 2021**
I finished off the Readmes, which went quicker with the tennis in the background. Some of them are all about the animation, so I found something that would screenshot video and save to gif. Although those files get big really quickly!
I also finished off the Wes Bos Beginner's React course. Today's videos were all about building and deploying to various places. Vercel just didn't seem to play well with Firebase, but Netlify was easy. I skipped the one about deploying to your own server, as I don't have one. And then the one about ejecting from Create-React-App was useful, as I'd heard about it but knew nothing about it except that you can't reverse it. I can see why it would be useful.

**Day 59: 15th February 2021**
I started working on The Newport Group website in Figma. It look me a little while to remember what I was doing in Figma, as I haven't used it for a while. But I soon got the hang of it. I came up with a fairly simple homepage that looks pretty good.

**Day 60: 16th February 2021**
Some more Figma designs. Since this will be a multi-page website, I came up with three more pages. They'll all be the same layout, which makes things easier, but I still had to find some images and videos and come up with content. Then I did the dark mode version of the pages, and the mobile version (for the light version, since the mobile is just about moving things around and the dark version is just about changing the colours). Now it's all ready to start programming.

**Day 61: 17th February 2021**
I started on The Newport Group website. Although most of the time I spent on it was sorting out Parcel and PostCSS. And in th end I'm not sure why it worked. I looked up HTML templates and it sounds complicated, whereas React sounds easier. And a good way to practise the simplest bits of React, just putting stuff on the page without state or props or hooks. So I watched a couple of short videos introducing React and talking about JSX to remind me about those.

**Day 62: 18th February 2021**
Did some more CSSing on The Newport Group website. Although I kept spending time trying to work out why Parcel wasn't updating - it turns out it's because there's an error in the CSS. It's hard to work out where it is when it just doesn't do anything. For now I'm just doing the simple CSS and will sort out the flashy bits and dark mode once I've got one page done. And then work out how I'm going to do the other pages.

**Day 63: 19th February 2021**
Did the footer part of the website, and then spent ages trying to get clip-path to work so I had a bit of a diagonal on the footer. I don't know why it didn't work the first time, because it worked when I deleted it all and started again. So the basics of the CSS are done, I just need to sort out focus and hover states, transitions and animations, and also lazy loading and moving things in using IntersectionObserver. And then that's the first page done for light mode...

**Day 64: 20th February 2021**
Done all the sliding bits and focus and hover states. I had to re-look up the IntersectionObserver because I couldn't  remember what I was doing where to slide things in. Turns out it's really simple and it's just a class - but it has to be more specific than the original or it defaults to the original. I think the flashy things cover for the fact that it's not the most exciting design...

**Day 65: 21st February 2021**
I learnt a lot today. I tried to change the colour on the buttons on hover and then found that it doesn't like using CSS variables - because it does the SASS function before it does the CSS ones. So I changed over to use SASS variables and then forgot how they worked with @use and it took a while to discover why it wasn't working.
I then played about with the list and decided to add a border and then animate it on hover and focus, which took some research to work out how to do that.
I then added a navigation, but all I managed on that was to animate the hambuger/cross icons. I looked up some ideas and there are so many different ways to do it. I spent ages trying to get my lines to cross in the middle and eventually found I just needed to update the top and bottom, rather than fiddling around with transform-origin and translating as well as rotating.

**Day 66: 22nd February 2021**
I spent today sorting out the nav links. It took me a while to work out how to decide how to hide and show it and then to get it to fade out and fade in. A google search led me to a post with an explanation and now it fades in and out and I understand why.

**Day 67: 23rd February 2021**
I sorted out the menu for desktop, which involved re-learning about position: sticky. I then tried using dark mode if that's your preference - which first involved finding out how to change to dark mode in Cinnamon. Annoyingly, every time I changed to dark mode the menu theme stayed dark. And the website didn't change at all. I need to program the theme switcher and then I can see whether it's something wrong with my programming. Although I found out that I need to go back to the SASS/CSS variable combination, which is a job for another day...

**Day 68: 24th February 2021**
I changed my variables over to CSS variables to use with dark mode. Then I upated SASS to use @forward, which made importing everything with @use a lot simpler. And then I set up dark mode, which worked, but I realised there were some bits that just don't work in dark mode. In trying to fix it I found some things going weird between the SASS and CSS variables. I've run out of time to fix it today, but hopefully it'll be a quick fix tomorrow.

**Day 69: 25th February 2021**
The reason the dark mode wasn't quite working yesterday was because I got confused with my colour labelling. So I fixed it and labelled them differently so they make more sense. I then did the JS for the dark mode, which was really simple. And then the cards looked awful in dark mode, so I played around with them trying to make them look good in both light and dark modes.

**Day 70: 26th February 2021**
I made the menu and dark mode icons fixed to the top on mobile and desktop. And then I decided to try installing React, which just led to errors. I tried installing everything in a new folder and eventually discovered the error is our old friend, postcss/autoprefixer. It had magically been fixed in the original - and in the new I could fix it by saving package.json, which was a bit weird. Once I got it all working I tried some React and it worked!
And then I found I'd upset Git by moving everything to a new folder and naming it the same name. And not having pushed my changes before renaming didn't help. I ended up going back to the original folder and giving it the original name and re-installing everything the same as I had in the new folder. And now it all works, including React and Git is happy. That just the best part of two hours to sort out...

**Day 71: 27th February 2021**
I added the footer using React (JSX) and that was all nice and easy. I then added the header and discovered that I had a load of scripts using elements in the header, which therefore now need to be in React because I can't refer to an element when it's no longer in the html. I looked up some examples and realised I need to learn hooks. So I read the documentation and think I get them (I did see them in the wild at codebar).
The menu wasn't too bad, once I got my head round it all. And realised I'd broken some bits in the CSS. But the dark mode was a pain. I understand now that when you set classes that has to be based on the state, because then it'll check when the state changes. And then I learnt that the state is triggered every time you run something that's not inside its own function - but handily you can run a function to set the state when the component first mounts. I got there in the end. And only then did I realise that I had some other js bits that I didn't notice weren't working... because they're also looking at elements in the header...

**Day 72: 28th February 2021**
I discovered that the way to get the nav to show which one is active is to use React Router. Which meant that all of my HTML needed to be in React. So I sorted that - and then had to split that into more bits. And spent some time learning Router. And trying to get the active class to show up - it makes a difference which order the a and lis are in.
And then I had to get my head round IntersectionObserver. There are a few complicated-looking tutorials, but I found one that basically has the usual IntersectionObserver, run from useEffects, using useRef to work out which one it is and useState to set the class. Much simpler!

**Day 73: 1st March 2021**
A lot of looping today. I have the cards being slightly further over/up and rather than doing a lot of nth-of-types, I put them in a SASS @for loop.
And then in React whenever I had very similar elements, I added them using a map. That took a while - it turned out it was because I was using curly brackets instead of rounded brackets. Once I used them then it was easy! My components look so much smaller and simpler now.

**Day 74: 2nd March 2021**
Just did a few bits today organising scripts and changing the functions to arrow functions. And then I started setting up the houses page. I've been doing things with the home page for so long that just putting in the HTML and working out the structure suddenly seems so different!

**Day 75: 3rd March 2021**
I got loads done on the houses page today: CSS on the intro section, added the quotes section, then CSS on that. I remembered that on Kevin Powell's videos about before and after pseudo elements he'd done quotes and found that you just tell it you want an open-quote and a close-quote and it's all there!

**Day 76: 4th March 2021**
I added the videos and did a bit of CSS to position them. But when I added the IntersectionObserver to the reviews I realised that it's waiting for all of them to be on the page, rather than doing each one separately. This is because they're in a loop, because the same thing is happening with the cards and it wasn't when they weren't inside a loop. I found out how to update the refs, but not how to use them in the classname.

**Day 77: 5th March 2021**
 I did a whole lot more googling about the problem, with no success. And then I wondered, can I use the ref in the ternary operator in the classname the same way I do with the ref. And it turns out the answer is yes. After all that, the answer was simple. I then discovered my css wasn't quite right, but that was easier to fix.
 The header was a bit of a mess - never 100vh, so I gave the title size a separate class and added the Header separately on the Houses page, with that class.

**Day 78: 6th March 2021**
Spent today with the video element, making a custom control. I only did a play and pause button, but that was hard enough! After looking at lots of different variations I ended up using state and refs - it was only when I read about state with objects that I realised what was going on and how to fix it.

**Day 79: 7th March 2021**
I created the two pages that are like the houses page. That was quick. I then put the video toggling script in its own script, so it's not in three places. After running aXe I fixed a few things. It's pretty much done, it's mostly testing to go, which I don't know how to do in React - and didn't know you could do with the JS things I have going on, so I need to look that all up.

**Day 80: 12th March 2021**
Learnt some React in the Codebar Festival this morning - I never knew you could set a state hook from a child. I went back to looking into whether the three pages I have that have the same setup could have the same components but with different content. I couldn't find anything in a search, but the things I learnt this morning gave me an idea of a way to try and it worked! So now I don't have essentially the same things in three different places.

**Day 81: 13th March 2021**
The last session yesterday evening was about accessibility testing. While the session was on I wrote notes on things I think I needed to look at and went through most of those. I thought I'd been through with a keyboard, but obviously hadn't got all that far, since the cards were confusing and the light/dark toggle wasn't even selectable. All sorted now. I just have a couple of things left to do, then I'm back to the to do list I had before the festival.

**Day 82: 15th March 2021**
I did a whole load of little things today, adding a skip link and then checking keyboard selecting again. And checked it all with a screenreader, which was interesting to listen to. I made the nav menu close when it loses focus and fixed some bits on mobile that weren't showing correctly. I also re-sized all the images so they're less huge and got it to show the relevant ones using srcset and size if they were images and media queries if they were background images.

**Day 83: 16th March 2021**
I spent some time reading and watching videos and coding along for React testing, using React Testing Libary, Jest and Enzyme. When I came to try doing some testing, first of all things didn't work. When I finally got them working my tests say the app isn't working, even though I know it is. I remember this from first learning testing - it's really hard work just to get anything to work. But once you've got it, then it's easy. I'm on the really hard work part at the moment.

**Day 84: 17th March 2021**
Managed to get one test to work... Turned out you had to re-find the elements and then it was happy that they'd changed. I spent most of my time trying to work out how to check the body's class and just couldn't find an answer. I'm hoping I'll be able to find something by coming back to it another day.

**Day 85: 19th March 2021**
I found the answer really quickly - it turned out that Enzyme's hasClass only works with things in the wrapper - which the body isn't. Once I found another way of checking the class was there, it worked. I then went onto checking the videos, found I had to change something in the code and then Parcel complained and I spent the rest of time trying to get back to a point where the thing actually loaded properly in the browser.

**Day 86: 20th March 2021**
Spent a lot of the day looking things up when my tests weren't working. Not helped by the DevTools not admitting my state was updating - but console.logs said they were, as did me actually testing. But when I tested with Jest/Enzyme, the console logs said it wasn't updating and the tests only worked as long as I only clicked once and did them in a specific order. Despite my beforeAll. I got something working, but I think I'll try testing that all properly in Cypress. Hopefully that'll work better...

**Day 87: 21st March 2021**
Another frustrating day today. I thought I was on to simpler tests, but it turns out that even if you don't test the intersection observer, it still wants to use it. I spent ages looking up examples to mock it - it turned out to be simple, of course. And then when I moved onto another file I got a strange error on srcset - which turned out not to be related to that but it was just not liking my template literal, even if I moved it. I just couldn't find any explanation for it. I decided to mock content instead and that took a while to understand how to do it. But eventually, it is done!

**Day 88: 22nd March 2021**
I thought I'd try the Nav tests that didn't work with Enzyme, with React Testing Library. It took me a little while to get my head around - not helped by using NavLink so it complained it wasn't inside Router. But once I did those tests worked a treat! Well, until I got to the focus/blur, but hopefully I'll be able to figure those out tomorrow.

**Day 89: 23rd March 2021**
I took a day off testing to go through FrontEnd Mentor and give some feedback. I felt much freer than on previous days, being stuck in a small testing box. I reminded myself how much I enjoy helping beginners. And it's also really useful to see other people's code and how they do it and organise it.

**Day 90: 24th March 2021**
I finally got somewhere with the testing and got all of the Nav tests I had in Enzyme working with React Testing Library. Which I think might actually be easier, now I understand it. I have such a long list of things to test and tidy - despite only having four pages, this site has a lot going on to test.

**Day 91: 26th March 2021**
Got some good testing going on today with React Testing Library. LightDark turned out to be easier to Enzyme, so I left it how it was, but I added more tests for Nav and Info. Lots of stuff being tested in all of those, which is good.

**Day 92: 27th March 2021**
Finally finished testing all the components (ie all the unit testing)! I had a problem with mocking a named function, but I went for a walk and solved it instantly when I got back. The code coverage report was helpful because it reminded me I needed to check that the pages worked for all the props - and for no props being passed. I just have the pages to go, which should be simple as they just contain the components (so the integration testing). And then I need to do e2e testing with Cypress.

**Day 93: 28th March 2021**
I've done all the Jest/Enzyme/React-Testing-Library testing! I don't have 100% coverage, but that's impossible to get because I have some things that they can't test (eg videos). And some of the line numbers it says aren't testing actually are! Everything that hasn't been tested with these three will get tested with Cypress.
