# Done today
**Day 1: 25th May 2020**
Set up this file. Set up v2 of my portfolio in GitHub.

**Day 2: 26th May 2020**
Done the header part of my portfolio - at least for mobiles of 375px width. I need to think about where to make the change for desktop, which will be easier once it's all in. But it was much easier to do from Figma than to work it out as I went along.

**Day 3: 27th May 2020**
Did the skill section and set up the projects section on my portfolio. What took the most time was adding in screenshots and information, which is the boring part.

**Day 4: 28th May 2020**
Did the contacts section and some desktop layout bits. Got stuck on sizing something, so I am hoping it will become obvious tomorrow.

**Day 5: 29th May 2020**
Spent some time adding effects and changing my mind a lot. Looking at examples on codepen was really helpful for deciding what I wanted to do.

**Day 6: 30th May 2020**
Finished my portfolio! Spent ages wondering why transform-origin wasn't working when I added it in a mixin. I eventually established that it was happy if both it and the transform were outside of the mixin. So I left it like that. But otherwise it works well on everything I tested it on and looks so much better than the old version.

**Day 7: 1st June 2020**
Went through my GitHub repositories, updating the readmes where they needed updating, archiving old ones and deleting all my forked copies of the Hacktoberfest ones. Then Scrimba emailed about a 7 day JavaScript course with challenges a bit like codewars. So I did the first one - I find out tomorrow if I did it right. It included Jasmine tests in the JS file, so that was interesting to see. I should take note and use it to learn Jasmine and find uses of it to practise it.

**Day 8: 2nd June 2020**
I think the Scrimba JS course is too easy, but it's good to have something to keep me doing some JS every day. I started looking at testing with FreeCodeCamp. But after four challenges I gave up because I was just pasting things without understanding why - and there's no explanation. There are a few video tutorials I've found, so I will go through those and see if any are useful.

**Day 9: 3rd June 2020**
I found some video tutorials on testing and watched a couple on unit testing - one on Jasmine and one on Jest. They are pretty similar, just some different syntax, but it was the principle and general usage I really needed to understand.

**Day 10: 4th June 2020**
I continued with the Jest testing video, with the integration part. I just need to finish it with the user testing and then try some testing for myself. I realised I didn't get an email about yesterday's Scrimba JS challenge. So then I did yesterday's and it took me a while to get my head around how to do it, but I got there in the end. Today's I wasn't sure about until I remembered I'd done it in FreeCodeCamp.

**Day 11: 8th June 2020**
I've spent the past couple of days on JavaScript unit (and integeration and user testing). Starting with the easiest one, unit testing, I took some 8kyu (and a 7kyu) kata in codewars and put in a project to do the testing myself. I'm glad I choe easy katas because the testing took me a while. But I am getting the hang of it now. So next I need to find some harder katas where I can split things into multiple functions and do more testing.

**Day 12: 9th June 2020**
Did two 6kyu katas. The testing came in useful because I could test stages to check it was ok, whereas I'd usually just do a console log.

**Day 13: 10th June 2020**
Did a 5kyu kata. It took me longer than I thought it would, and didn't help that I did more than the kata was asking for, as I found when one of codewars tests found. But I can really see why you'd put small bits in functions so you can test those bits are working.

**Day 14: 11th June 2020**
I went through three videos of a series on testing, so now I understand it a bit better. I need to do the rest of the videos to see how better to apply it. I did the first day of Scrimba's email CSS challenges. It was really easy, but they did say it would get harder.

**Day 15: 15th June 2020**
Caught up on Scrimba's CSS email challenges. I definitely need to look into CSS animations (rather than just transitions) some more. But so far it's all been pretty easy. But the past few days have all been things I only learnt recently, so it's good that I spent a lot of time in 100 days round 2 on CSS.

**Day 16: 16th June 2020**
Did the second in the series of the 5kyu kata I did last week. It was hard, even though it built on the code I'd written for the first part. But I am starting to get more of an idea of what tests to write and what order to write them/the code.

**Day 17: 17th June 2020**
Finished off the Scrimba CSS series. Which never got hard, just had more animations in. I definitely need to play with animations a bit more. I watched another testing video. it was about mocking APIs and I really need to revise APIs and use them some more, but I remember enough to follow along, and it was very helpful in explaining unit testing generally.

**Day 18: 18th June 2020**
Watched some more unit testing videos. Then, because it was short and I didn't have much time, watched one on Parcel.

**Day 19: 19th June 2020**
I did a couple of 7kyu katas for some light relief and then found a couple series that start at 7kyu and get harder. And then took ages on the 7kyus refactoring them to have fewer lines of code.

**Day 20: 20th June 2020**
I set up a project with Parcel, which took a while. It turns out it doesn't like it if there's nothing in the body apart from the js file. And then Jest complained about the js importing the scss, although it turns out you can just add the scss into the html's head. I think I set up ESLint, but I'm not sure if it's working yet. And then I set up ome tests. Next I need to work out properly what I'm doing in JS and design something in Figma.

**Day 21: 21st June 2020**
I did a couple of 6kyus that were in the series I did on the 19th. One wasn't too hard, but the other took a long time - the discussions did say people thought it was closer to a 5kyu than a 6kyu. I started my project layout in Figma, but I need to think about how to make it more interesting/have the relevant bits stand out.

**Day 22: 22nd June 2020**
Finished most of the testing challenges on FreeCodeCamp. Although they're a different language I understand now much better what they were trying to teach me. I then did a few katas on codewars - I found another couple of series that have n easy and a hard, which make the hard ones much easier to do.

**Day 23: 27th June 2020**
Took some time off to watch tennis and be too hot to turn on a computer. It meant I was looking forward to getting back into coding. I decided to ease myself in with some codewars katas. There was a 6kyu one in this week's email that looked interesting and was based on another kata. So I did that kata, and when I looked at the solutions I discovered I'd forgotten replace was a thing (again). I was close to 4kyu, so I did a 7kyu one. And then although I was then at 4kyu it was overall, I was still at 5kyu for JavaScript. So I have to do some more to achieve that goal.

**Day 24: 28th June 2020**
Goal achieved! I got 4kyu in JavaScript. I did the 6kyu kata that went with the one I did yesterday. Using the best practise solution made it much easier. But since I am 4kyu overall, that got me a lot less close to 4kyu in JavaScript than I thought it would. I found an interesting 5kyu kata that people said was much easier, so I did that and it didn't take long. So now I am 4kyu in JavaScript! Now I've achieved that, I need to get back to projects so I can tick off some more of my learning goals.

**Day 25: 29th June 2020**
I got an email from Kevin Powell (on his email list) that talked about how he learned and one of the things he mentioned was that once he understood something new he'd make a video on it. I've seen lots of things about explaining what you know to help you remember it. Having gone "Oh, yes, replace() is a thing, I must remember that" at the weekend, I thought I'd write a blog post about it. Which turned out to take a lot longer than I thought it would. Not to mention fiddling with the blog: I thought going with wordpress.com, where you can't change much, would mean I wouldn't spend ages fiddling with it. I was wrong. I am no linking to it yet because a blog with one post isn't much. Plus I still have the example stuff up and need to sort out the about and contact pages.

**Day 26: 30th June 2020**
Work wiped me out, so I watched some videos. One on focus styles was really interesting and I need to go back to my portfolio to add them in. Then one on parallax, which I need to try out. Then I watched one Coder Coder's series on making a Frontend Mentor layout. It's really useful to see how someone would approach it - it's helped me understand how to approach that sort of thing myself. Then I sorted out the About and Contact pages on my blog, which didn't take long, and signed up up Scrimba's 10 day JS challenge. And decided to number the days because although I'm not doing 100 days of code again, it's useful to see how much I've learnt in a certain number of days.

**Day 27: 3rd July 2020**
I caught up with Coder Coder's series on coding a Frontend Mentor layout. I think I want to try another, now that I've seen her way of doing it. I caught up with Scrimba's JS challenges, but they are still really easy. Then I watched Ania's video on making the Chrome dinosaur game. The code is surprisingly easy, it's knowing what sort of things to do to get it to do what you want that's hard, I think. I will try and work on adding to it. I thought I'd start creating infinite kittens, then discovered it uses IntersectionObserver, and although I've used MutationObserver I'm not sure about IntersectionObserver. Kevin has a YouTube series on it, so I will go through that at some point.

**Day 28: 4th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game, adding things to do it. And a long to do list! After playing it a lot I had to add an option to turn the background off because it was making me dizzy. But it's been fun and interesting and I've learnt more about how what we did in the tutorial works.

**Day 29: 5th July 2020**
I worked more on the dinosaur game. It took me ages to understand what was going on with the cacti when you click play after having died. Now I really understand what removeChild does. And then I spent ages trying to work out a formula to get the background and cacti to move at the same speed no matter what size your browser window is. And then I updated my blog talking about learning and realised the about page wasn't that useful.

**Day 30: 6th July 2020**
I worked more on the dinosaur game. Not as much time today, but I did get the background speed sorted and did a couple of small changes. I've almost done all the JS on the to do list!

**Day 31: 8th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game. Getting it work in lower gravity was not quite how I expected, but I worked it out in the end.

**Day 32: 10th July 2020**
I worked on the dinosaur game. I sored out the high scores for Earth and the moon and made it work if you tap the screen. I also added some animation to the end to have the dinosaur fall over and the obstacles fade out.

**Day 33: 11th July 2020**
I did quite a bit of CSS on the dinosaur game. It doesn't look like much but the toggle took a while as it needed to be a checkbox rather than a button. Then when I first did it I discovered it wasn't accessible, so then I needed to re-do it and then re-work out how to add the on and off text.

**Day 34: 12th July 2020**
Did some work on the CSS on the dinosaur game, sorting out the layout. It looks so much better with a decent font and with everything laid out, rather than next to each other.

**Day 35: 13th July 2020**
Played about with some images, so the game now involves a dragon jumping over curling rocks. Since they could be said to have been thrown at him, it means we no longer need the background. So all that time I spent getting it moving at the same speed as the cacti was useless... But I can use the background toggle as a sound toggle, so all that work is not completely lost.

**Day 36: 14th July 2020**
Finished the dinosaur game - which is now the dragon jupming game. And then when I tried it on mobile I found some things to change, so I will do that tomorrow. The sounds turned out to be a pain because I did the game over one first. When I press Play Again the page then reloads and the browser doesn't think I've pressed anything, if I haven't jumped. That was fixed by jumping before dying. I could put a lot of work in to fix that, but it's not going to be the end of the world if there's no sound on game over. Plus I've spent a lot of time on this game and have other things I want to get to, so it's time to stop adding in features.

**Day 37: 15th July 2020**
Finished off the dragon jupming game - sorting out a few bits that didn't work on mobile. As useful as VS Code's live server is, using Gulp is better because then I can use it to check the page on mobile without having to upload it to somewhere. I also sorted out the focus states on my portfolio and added the Dragon Jumping Game to it. I also finished off the Pirate Island Conquer series on Codewars.

**Day 38: 17th July 2020**
Watched the last part of Coder Coder's video on the Frontend Mentor site. It was so useful - I am looking forward to working on another site and using teh tips and tricks I've picked up from those videos.

**Day 39: 19th July 2020**
Finished the section of the UI course I was on. I am excied to do the next sections about shadows and animation because those are the ones I'm less sure about what is good UI. I did a couple of katas on codewars that were in my email because they looked interesting. One a 6kyu and one a 7kyu that's part of a gaming series. I am looking forward to doing the 6kyu and 5kyus in that series. I also wrote a couple of blog posts about the things I actually remembered to use for once!

**Day 40: 22nd July 2020**
Finally got back to Guess the Number. I've got the browser doing what the unit tests are doing. I learnt more about tests, when I had some code not in a function make the tests unhappy.

**Day 41: 23rd July 2020**
I got to the point where I needed to do some user testing, so went to use Puppeteer, as I've done in a tutorial. But then spent ages fighting with it and trying to understand the documentation. I think I might have got in a mess with installing it, so I might have to start again with a new folder and see if that fixes it.

**Day 42: 25rd July 2020**
Turns out Parcel and Puppeteer don't play well together and can't both be running at once. But I still have a problem with Puppeteer leaking that I can't work out how to fix.

**Day 43: 1st August 2020**
Took a break and I'm none the wiser. But it seems that Jest will do DOM manipulation. So I will try that when I have more of a brain. Meanwhile I changed some of the functionality to get it how I want, so then I can just get the tests working and not have to change them.

**Day 44: 2nd August 2020**
Took a break from Guess the Number to revise asynchronous code to see if anything then jumped out at me with my data leak. It didn't, but I now understand what everything in the test function is doing, which is a start.

**Day 45: 3rd August 2020**
I understand why my second Puppeteer test failed, although not yet how to fix it. I tried to do some DOM manipulation in Jest and got confused. I found a simple example, which mine was similar to, but that just didn't work. When searching for the answer I came across Cypress, which looks like it will do the same thing only simpler. I only had time to install it and read a bit of the docs, but I am looking forward to trying it out tomorrow.

**Day 46: 4th August 2020**
Cypress is so easy! Well, there's lots of stuff about it I still need to learn, but I've done all the tests I've been struggling to do with Cypress for a while.

**Day 47: 5th August 2020**
Did some more Cypress testing. It's a bit different to unit testing where you test little things at a time. This one you test everything at once, because it will stop at the first failure and show you it. I think I am done with the JavaScript for Guess the Number, so next I need to do the CSS.

**Day 48: 19th August 2020**
Took a break for the heatwave and working a lot of overtime. I decided to ease myself in gradually and finished off the Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai section on FreeCodeCamp now that I've revised async. It was easy, except that somehow the brackets got in a mess - I ended up putting the whole thing in VSCode and beautifying it before I could see what was wrong. I then did the Managing Packages with NPM module, which told me more about what was going on with the package.json.

**Day 49: 20th August 2020**
I started Data Visualization with D3 on FreeCodeCamp to see what it was like. It's just like JavaScript really, just with some different syntax. At least so far - I've only just started and haven't got to anything complicated yet.

**Day 50: 21st August 2020**
I did some more of D3 on FreeCodeCamp. It's useful having already done a lot of JS and worked with some SVGs, so that's keeping it simple. I'm not sure I'm keen on it though. But, of course, that could be because I haven't got to the interesting bits yet.

**Day 51: 22nd August 2020**
I finished the D3 challenges. I have concluded I'm not as interested in it as I am creating websites and games. But the certification might be useful to do because it is pretty much JS and would make me practise SVGs and arrow functions. And also it involves using APIs to get the data, which I also need to practise.

**Day 52: 23rd August 2020**
I did the shadows module of the UI Design Bootcamp. I had been looking forward to it and it was really good - I now understand a lot more about how to do use box shadows and how to make them look good.

**Day 53: 24th August 2020**
I did the gradients module of the UI Design Bootcamp. I've used gradiants quite a bit, but this was really useful for understanding how to use them to make things look good, which I wasn't so good on before.

**Day 54: 25th August 2020**
I did the forms module of the UI Design Bootcamp. I struggled with this, not because it was hard and I didn't know what to do, but because I spend so much time looking at forms, effectively, that I have a lot of opinons on it and didn't always agree with the designs he came up with. But I think this is an area where I know too much, as forms aren't going to be quite as involved as a survey.

**Day 55: 26th August 2020**
Started a challenge on Codingame. It took me a while to remember how it all worked. Then the one I picked was actually quite tricky, so I didn't finish it.

**Day 56: 27th August 2020**
Finished the Codingame challenge. I wish when you submitted it showed you other people's solutions, like on codewars, so I can see how I might have done it better/more simply.

**Day 57: 29th August 2020**
Went back to the UI Design Bootcamp and did two-thirds of the animation module. I struggled with this, partly because I twice thought I was deleting something in the CSS and it actually took me a back a page, thus losing what I'd done. And also because I struggled with the design and what it was supposed to look like, because I didn't think it looked that good at any point.

**Day 58: 31st August 2020**
Finished the animation module of the UI Design Bootcamp. Although the Greensock lesson was hard to work out what was going on because there was nothing to see. I started the final project, but so far it's just been watching the HTML set up.

**Day 59: 2nd September 2020**
Finished the UI Design Bootcamp! I did learn a lot, but I found it hard to follow sometimes because the cursor wouldn't point to the same place I was seeing as he was. And anything he did at the bottom never scrolled down far enough. I struggled a bit with his markup too - I knew what I wanted to do, but if I was doing it I'd have done the HTML differently. Not to mention that some of the contrast in the live browser was hard to see on a sunny day or not in natural light. So it's been good and useful, but a bit frustrating.

**Day 60: 4th September 2020**
Added in accessibility testing with Cypress to Guess the Number. Although I found that running axe in the browser gave me more useful error messages. All the testing was still useful, as it threw up something that I broke when I fixed the accessibility.

**Day 61: 5th September 2020**
Payed with the form in Guess the Number. It's got a bit complicated about where to do validation and whether the form submits.

**Day 62: 6th September 2020**
Finally sorted out the submit problems in Guess the Number. Which meant I could then start on the CSS.

**Day 63: 7th September 2020**
Finished off Guess the Number! It's looking so much better now. But I need to test it on my phone and Parcel's localhost doesn't allow that. So I'll have to upload it in order to test it. It also means that I think I'll go back to Gulp - I do have it set up and sorted now, which is what takes the most amount of time. And at least it involves fewer files.

**Day 64: 8th September 2020**
Tested Guess the Number on different devices, made a few changes and now it's all done! I feel like I've been working on it for so long that I'm excited to do something different. And play with Jest and Cypress some more on a new project.

**Day 65: 9th September 2020**
Set up the Red Dwarf XII animation. Just installing all the Gulp files takes a while! But now it's all ready to start.

**Day 66: 10th September 2020**
I'm so glad you can adjust properties in the dev tools because getting the ellipse looking right and positioned right depended on changing multiple properties at the same time. And was a total pain.

**Day 67: 11th September 2020**
Did some more stuff on the logo. Gettings the red of the ellipse behind the gaps in the R and D was a bit of a pain, but that was all about size and positioning again. I couldn't get the W and A behind the red of the ellipse without them also being behind the black of the ellipse, which has to be on top of the red by definition. So I used before and after to recreate the red section. And then discovered on the animation that the ellipse is behind all the letters, it's only on the non-moving logo that it's in front. Oh, well, at least I was confident in using before and after, which I never would have been able to do six months ago.

**Day 68: 12th September 2020**
Added the starfield and most of the animations on the logo. THe starfield turned out to be more complicated than I thought because it needed to be on top of the black ellipse but below the red ellipse, even though the black ellipse needs to be on top of the red ellipse. I ended up doing a separate starfield for that. Then the animations turned out to be a bit more complicated. I feel like coming back to it will make crossing the two Is to make an X easier.

**Day 69: 13th September 2020**
Animated the two Is to make an X. Which was easier after a break. Although what took the most time was trying different methods to get them to animate at all, and then finding it was because I'd spelt deg as eg...

**Day 70: 19th September 2020**
Watched two of Kevin's recent videos about margin auto (which was mind-blowing - positioning is much easier than I thought it was) and about the space under images, which I don't think I've ever had a problem with, but it's useful to know about. Mostly sorted out the triangles on the bottom of the Xs, so they have a flat bottom. It needs a bit more sorting, but it's mostly there.

**Day 71: 20th September 2020**
Finally got the numeral animation sorted out. Lots of fun with triangles...

**Day 72: 24th September 2020**
Started on making everything proportional. Which turns out to be really hard - it took me ages to work out the exact positionings of everything and now I have to re-work it out (made especially difficult by needing to change the text size depending on the purple circle's size).

**Day 73: 25th September 2020**
Didn't really achieve much. I tried using various fit text js things to sort out the text size, but they didn't work. I tried using an SVG instead and that didn't really work plus added in complications with letter colouring and the before and afters I needed.

**Day 74: 25th September 2020**
Finally got the text sizing sorted by working out a system in px and doing it in JS. Mostly I'm just amazed it works! I then fixed the ellipse, which was just as much of a pain to position in percent as it was in px.

**Day 75: 26th September 2020**
Managed to sort out the numeral sizes, which was a complete pain. It's just not as easily relatable to the font size as I thought it was going to be.

**Day 76: 27th September 2020**
Found the triangles on the Xs weren't quite right. It feels like every time I fix something, I come back the next day and find something wrong with it. I've now got it all sorted - I hope! - except for the canvas on window resize.

**Day 77: 28th September 2020**
I realised I didn't need to use the canvas to add the stars, they could just be divs. They made it much easier to redraw them all when the window was resized. I also found a simple way to only run the animations when everything is loaded, so it doesn't all run twice any more.

**Day 78: 3rd October 2020**
I added the sun, which took a while. I thought I was done, but then opened it in Chrome and it's a complete mess. I have no idea why, but I think I checked it when everything was a specific size and it was fine then. It's obviously interpreting something differently to Firefox, but finding out what is a job for another day.

**Day 79: 4th October 2020**
The Red Dwarf XII animation is done! I just need to check it everywhere now I've pushed it all to master and uploaded it, but that can wait for another day. I'm just glad it's done now - it's been fun, but it's taken a while and I'm looking forward to doing something else.

**Day 80: 5th October 2020**
The Red Dwarf XII animation was fine, so I've declared it done. I started on a StyleStage layout. I had an idea for a rainbow layout, so I've been having fun adding rainbow colours all over the place. Not yet worrying about whether it's readable or laid out well. But I have learnt more about nth-child and grids.

**Day 81: 11th October 2020**
Did some more of the rainbow layout. I don't really have a plan, I just keep adding rainbows to things and seeing how it looks! It's fun, though.

**Day 82: 12th October 2020**
Did some more of the rainbow layout. It's getting frustrating deciding what to change,

**Day 83: 13th October 2020**
Did a load more work on the rainbow layout. I sat down and made a plan, and although I changed a few things after that, it made everything so much easier. It is all sorted in Firefox. I opened it in Chrome and noticed a few things that aren't working, but that's something for another day.

**Day 84: 14th October 2020**
I did Scrimba's web dev weekly thing. And submitted it for the contest. I feel like other people will go really fancy with amazing designs, but I went simple, with just shades of one colour (plus black). I didn't have time to get to the stretch goals - I could go back and do them, but I want to get the style stage layout done.

**Day 85: 15th October 2020**
Got the Style Stage rainbow layout working in Chrome and on mobile. I spent some time finding things that don't work the same in both browsers (eg Firefox splits words at the slash but Chrome doesn't, also mobiles don't do fixed backgrounds - but it looks pretty cool unfixed too). I just need to test it on Windows tomorrow, and hopefully I'll be able to submit it soon.

**Day 86: 16th October 2020**
I submitted my Style Stage CSS. The process is much less scary than it was this time last year when I've never done a PR. I do them often, since I found that doing them on GitHub is much easier than in SmartGit (in SmartGit I always get confused about which branch I should be on to start with). I'm still a bit nervous about feedback and possible changes, but I can see that other people had them and fixed them and no one was horrible about it, so it will be fine..

**Day 87: 17th October 2020**
I had a small changed to make to my style stage submission, then it was all accepted. There it is on the site - how exciting! I started working on a HTML Canvas challenge. I had a few ideas, which I then dismissed because it's just so much easier to draw shapes in CSS than on the canvas. I ended up taking the fireworks I did and modifying them. They look cooler now. But I want to add other elements - there's already fireworks in there (which are completely different from mine) but to further differentiate it I want to make it Bonfire Night. So more things to add tomorrow.

**Day 88: 18th October 2020**
Worked on the canvas challenge some more. Finding out that you can have multiple canvases has made adding backgrounds a lot easier. Although I faded the Catherine Wheels out they don't look as good as the fireworks. I will have to think about making them better or taking them out before I submit it. Although I'm not sure the fire is going to look as good as the fireworks either, but so fire I've only done the base part which won't be animated.

**Day 89: 19th October 2020**
The canvas thing was keeping me awake, and it felt like eveyrthing I added to it looked terrible in comparison to the fireworks. So I've taken everything else out and just kept the fireworks (and the stars). I got myself into a mess with my default branch in Github, so that made everything take a bit longer. Adding it to the repo takes a few more steps, so I'll save that for tomorrow when I'm (hopefully) feeling more awake.

**Day 90: 20th October 2020**
I submitted the canvas. I'm glad I'm left it a day, because I was slightly more awake and still got confused. That took long enough that I decided that was enough for one night.

**Day 91: 21st October 2020**
In another Hacktober repo I found you have to do a simple task of just adding some information to a file. Then you can do the CSS for a calculator, then you can work with others on fixing/improving an app. So I did the first task. And still got confused about what was going on with Git and where I was pushing to. I think I've got the simple stuff, but I need to go back and learn the more complex bits that I don't use so much day-to-day.

**Day 92: 22nd October 2020**
I started on the CSS calculator. There were a few odd grid bits and input bits, but I think it's done - it was pretty simple, and all the scripting to make it work was already done. I am going to leave it and come back to it tomorrow to see if there's anything else I think it needs, and test it on other devices.

**Day 93: 23rd October 2020**
The calculator turned out to be a massive pain on iOS. I eventually found out it added its own styling for form inputs and buttons, so I had to explicity tell it not to do that. I eventually managed to get it to the state where I could submit a PR. Although I fetched the upstream and it didn't actually seem to do anything, which is a bit odd.

**Day 94: 25th October 2020**
Spent a while looking through a couple of Hacktober repositories for things that needed doing. I ended up with Task 3 on the one I did Task 1 and 2 on most recently. There are a few issues to improve bits of the app. I had a look at it, and it's really simple. I managed to do one of them, so I just need to wait and see if me being assigned to it has been okayed, then check it on other browsers/devices tomorrow.

**Day 95: 26th October 2020**
It's a good thing I gave it a day to check because I found a couple of things wrong. It's done now, and just requires the maintainer to check if what I did was right. I had more fun with Git because I realised I gave my branch the wrong name. It's interesting how many of these things are easier to fix in the terminal. The quesstion is: is that because typing commands in the terminal is inherently easier or because SmartGit isn't actually that easy to use?
